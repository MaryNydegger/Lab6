# Lab 6:  APIs and Webscraping

### Instructions - please read and follow carefully
* *Accept the Assignment*: When you accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom, a repository named `lab-06` will be automatically generated for you under the "s386Fall2023" organization.
* *Locate Your Repository*: Your personal repository for this homework can be found at `https://github.com/s386Fall2023/lab-06-your_user_name`.
* *Clone the Repository*: 
    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to download the repository.
    - Run `git clone your_repository_URL` to clone the repository onto your local machine.
* *Working Directory*: The cloning process will create a new directory named `lab-06-your_user_name`. Ensure that you perform all your work inside this directory.
* *Commit Your Progress*: As you work on the assignment, remember to commit your changes periodically. You can easily do this using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
* *Remote Connection*: If you've cloned the repository correctly and are working within the created directory, the remote link to your GitHub repository should already be configured.
* *File and Function Names*: 
    - The answers to all the questions should be in the `answers.txt` file.  You will most likely edit the file manually (replace the `XXX` with your answer) 
      * ONLY replace the `XXX`.  Do not add any lines, delete or change problem numbers, or change the file name.
      * Do NOT round decimal numbers (all `float` answers should have AT LEAST 4 decimals)
    - Include your code in the repository.  Ensure that your code is neat and well documented.  
    - Include all requests `.csv` files
    - **IMPORTANT** I am not providing at `.gitignore` for this assignment so you will need to create your own.
* *Virtual Environment*: Ensure that you are using the class's virtual environment while working on this assignment.
   - Note:  There is no way to tell from your submission whether or not you use the class environment.  However, if you are working in the virtual environment set up for our class, then you can be sure that you are using the correct versions of the packages.
* *Submitting on Gradescope*: 
    - Once you've completed the assignment, go to Gradescope and select your personal homework repository (`https://github.com/s386Fall2023/lab-06-your_user_name`) as the source for your submission.
